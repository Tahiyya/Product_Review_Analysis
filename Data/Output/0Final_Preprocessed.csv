Ananth Machiraju,5,The iPhone 13 is the new benchmark for flagship phones...!,"We're pretty confident when we say that the iPhone 13 is the best iPhone for most people. It may look like Apple has only changed the position of one of the phone's back cameras since last year's model, but trust us when we say that there are more substantial upgrades than that. With a new display, larger battery, and better camera hardware and software, the iPhone 13 is the new benchmark for flagship phones.Once again, Apple's made the iPhone 13 far more powerful than its Android competitors thanks to its 5G-ready A15 Bionic chip. If the raw performance doesn't interest you, photographers can play with the new Photographic Style filters in the camera app, while videographers will be excited by the new Cinematic mode focus-racking ability.The regular iPhone 13 has some flaws. The charging is still relatively slow compared to some Android phones. And I don't like that only the iPhone 13 Pro models get a 120Hz display and telephoto zoom. But based on my in-depth iPhone 13 review, this new iPhone is the best phone for the money.The overall display quality continues to be stellar. When watching the trailer for The Matrix Resurrections, I was mesmerized by the neon code encircling Neo as he walked down the street, and in another scene, I could make out individual hairs on Neo‚Äôs beard as he stared up into the sun.DISPLAY1. Smaller notch makes the display a bit more immersive2. Slightly different button placement3. Pink and blue are standout colors4. New Green color launched March 2022CAMERA1. Bright and colorful images beat Samsung2. Ultra-wide camera delivers more scenes and improved Night mode3. Photographic styles give you creative controlVIDEO1. Cinematic mode automatically changes focus on subjects while adding bokeh2. Superior Dolby Vision HDR video qualityPERFORMANCE and A15 Bionic1.A15 Bionic is the fastest chip once again2. Machine learning performance notably betterBATTERY LIFE1.10 hours and 33 minutes of battery life, which is 2 hours better than the iPhone 12Software1.SharePlay lets you watch videos and listen to music with friends2. Focus cuts down on distractionsVERDICT :The iPhone 13 improves on what was already the best iPhone for most people by introducing a bunch of welcome enhancements. I especially like the longer battery life, as the iPhone 12‚Äôs endurance was underwhelming even for a 5G phone. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend that iPhone 12 owners upgrade to the new iPhone, but the iPhone 13 is worth it if you own an iPhone 11 or older device.I don‚Äôt think many people will care about the smaller notch. What truly stands out on the iPhone 13 is the camera. The low-light performance is even better now, and computational photography features like Cinematic mode and Photographic styles flex the A15 Bionic‚Äôs muscles in ways that go way beyond benchmarks.I‚Äôm also glad Apple doubled the starting storage at 128GB, as that move was overdue and puts the new iPhone on par with Android flagships. I‚Äôd like to see Apple offering faster charging next time around ‚Äî be it via USB-C or MagSafe ‚Äî as well as a 120Hz display.The bottom line is that the iPhone 13 is a fantastic phone and raises the bar for what you think a camera phone can do.",Reviewed in India on 27 July 2022,/gp/customer-reviews/R3AREU80JEE5EO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09G9FPGTN,39,India,27-07-2022,POSITIVE

ApTreX,5,Truly worth the money spent! Even if you go broke!,"My honest review after going broke buying this depreciating object.I have been using android phones since the last 10 years and finally decided to switch to iPhone! I used to roast iPhone for its prices, lack of features and also things like power adapter not given in box etc, but my last android phone (iqoo 7 legend) had lot of software related issues and battery issues after updating it to android 12, tired of bugs and software glitches in android, I finally decided to buy a iPhone and switch from android to iOS And Boy Was I right!I never even held an iPhone In my life before because of its price, but now I made a great choice even if I had to spend all my savings on it.iPhone 13 is so smooth that even my IQOO 7 Legend with 120hz feels slower than it even if iPhone has only 60hz. And I can‚Äôt believe what I‚Äôm seeing, all the games/apps are so much smoother and optimised than on android.I was very sceptical about the charging speed of an iPhone Because in Iqoo I had 66w fast charger where as for iPhone I had to buy 20w separate fast charger for 1800rs, but charging speed isn‚Äôt disappointing.Display quality is truly flagship level and I‚Äôm quite a fan of the small 6.1 display believe it or not, being able to reach the top of display with just one hand is very helpful, Build quality is great.I would recommend NOT to waste extra 40k for buying 13 pro. Because I don‚Äôt think having a extra camera telephoto lens is worth spending 40k.You can see in the 3rd image attached the quality of wide angle camera pic shot on my iPhone 13, wide angle camera struggles in low light, but main camera is really good, captures true colours. Front camera is really good too, truly flagship.Speakers are Great.Battery life is better than my previous devices,iOS is very optimised in terms of battery life, easy 8hrs sot on normal usage.NOTE : While playing BGMI you loose around 2% battery every 6minutes at HD + Extreme Graphics. Which is also good. Pro Max Would Be far better in terms of battery.For the software? Yes I feel like there are few downsides, even if the software is very smooth and has very less bugs, it has two annoying things : any game gets paused when you open control centre just to check the battery etc, Lock Screen is annoying and also having to reach the top left corner just to see notifications is also annoying, clearing all notifications is also very annoying.But other than that a perfect 10/10 purchase. I was very disappointed at myself when I paid for the iPhone but when I received it I was truly happy that I bought it.Truly worth it.",Reviewed in India on 6 February 2022,/gp/customer-reviews/R1ROPVLONGNUAZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09G9FPGTN,51,India,06-02-2022,POSITIVE

Amazon told me they can only give a replacement if I get a delivery report and service report from iPlanet Care, so I got then and mailed them. Remember they bluntly said there are no refund on this. Now sometime back Amazon said they cant even give me a replacement also and its totally being handled by apple.

debarghyo chaudhuri,4,Review after 1 week of usage,"Got it for 65K on Amazon prime day. So as a lifelong android user I have switched to IOS. So will be dividing this into the pros and negs:Product red 128GBPros:1) Received genuine product from Amazon( was quite sceptic about it though)2) Built quality excellent3) Camera quality excellent. True to life color reproduction, Indoor conditions amazing, night photos are good, facial tones are very good, day clicks are amazing. In short it's an amazing exp. Selfie cam also produces very good quality images. And also no shift in dynamic range while shifting B/W wide and ultra wide cams.4) Display:- Its a really great display, not 120 hz, but the experience is no less than a 120 hz, coz of apple's great software optimization, buttery smooth, no jitters on the screen, won't feel like a 60 hz panel. Now the notch, yes it will be bothering a little bit but its got its own functions, face unlock and stuff (works great in all environmental conditions)after a little while you get adjusted and it got its own magic functions like when when the phone rings and you go close to it, it detects your presence and lowers the vol level.5) Performance: Most powerful processor in the world.6) Battery:- With light usage will easily go for 2 days and with heavy 1 day. Remember to follow a charging pattern and it will give a solid battery exp.7) Speakers: Very loud with a small thumpCons:1) To keep photos and stuff you need to buy storage. 5 GB by default but that's nothing. Download google photos as an alternate sol. if you don't wanna buy storage.2) File management system sucks, android is much better.3) It has dolby atmos but for that you need a subscription to Apple music.4) Does not have a telephoto cam, which I think is a must at this price point.5) Somehow I am not getting 4g+ on my airtel, don't know why but in my android phone always used to get that.6) No USB C7) Siri is dumb AF8) Apple maps are not good, so download Google maps.9) Google keypad is much better than apple's.10) Notification panel and those small things like typing in the notification panel and other things that you can do in android is much much better than apple.11) As of now no haptic feedback while typing maybe coming on IOS 16Note:- Apple ecosystem still exploring that part but whenever you click any pic it automatically gets updated and I can see it in my Macbook also.Overall I would say if you are planning to buy a phone for responsiveness and does the everyday stuff without any hanging problems and stuff then buy it, and also if you are planning to keep it for a long time, then I think its a good investment for the future. Its got Great resale value.Hope this helps in making your decision easier.Update after 2 weeks of usage:All the above points remains the same, but I did check out the ecosystem and the experience has been amazing.1) I can receive and make phone calls (cellular calls) from my macbook, and the call quality is also good.So basically you can keep your phone in some other section of the house and you are working with your macbook somewhere else and if some call comes you can receive that on your macbook. PS:- your phone and macbook should be connected to a similar network, i.e wi-fi.2) Airplay- Just from the lock screen itself i can play any video and also listen to music from my phone. So basically you can watch youtube amazon prime videos(app not in the macbook but present on phone) and other stuff and also listen to music, and the switch of devices is also seamless. So someone in my house can use my macbook to watch movies on amazon prime(playing from my phone) and I can browse linkedin or FB from my iphone.",Reviewed in India on 30 July 2022,/gp/customer-reviews/R16W6CTIKEUDKM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09G9FPGTN,85,India,30-07-2022,POSITIVE

Jnan Shetty,5,Using after 3 months honest review,"This is my first iPhone and it always feels good to hold this masterpiece. This looks premium not just because of its branding, it has everything which makes it feel premium. However, despite all the looks and finish, the transition from Android to Apple is not very smooth and you may constantly lack certain features that can make life easy. I was using vivo y19 Lite before this and still have that phone with me. Putting out the feature that is being missed by me-1. Forwarding Anything in Whatsapp: Forwarding anything in Whatsapp from IPhone takes bit more step as compared to what is being offered in Android. This makes the entire process slow for an Android User2. App Switcher: Apple could have easily made App Switcher easy with just light Swipe up, instead they made it with long pressed Swipe up. Why man, why.. You don't have any features for Swipe up, just make it easy to launch.3. Andorid Dialer is Always Missed: Every android has a basic feature, where you can search the contact directly from Phone Dialer, here Dialer is used for Dialing Number only and it will not suggest you similar contact from contacts or last Dial. This is really bad.. If you have to Dial a number directly, use Dialer.. If you have to dial someone from Recent Call log, shift to that and if you to dial someone from contact, shift to that. Man, all this can be done under one button, under dialer. Android user will miss this very badly.4. Sending Multiple Files in Whatsapp: If you wants to add more than 1 file directly from whatsapp, you have to do it twice. In Android, one can simple start selecting from whatspp itself and can select as many files as they wants and can send in a single click. Here for sending multiple files, you have to go to gallery or folder and select all files first and share it through whatsapp.5. No Swipe based shifting from Chats to Status and to calls: In Android Whatsapp, you can switch between Calls, Chats and Status by just swiping, here you have to press button of each.6. Contact Viewing: Contact list sorting method is still out of my mind. Man, make it easy. For example, if one of your contacts First Name or Middle Name or Last Name, any one of thing start with Alphabet ""A"", than it will be shown on top of the list. Apple, pls adopt any one method or at least allow us to customise it.7. Many Apps in Android are much more refined than its version on Apple.8. This is for those who had use Samsung Pay: Samsung Pay was one of the best app for making UPI or Card Payment, just swipe up from home screen of Samsung Phones (Only S Series) and the app is open for payment, I miss that here very badly.9. Lack of Dual Messenger Facility: You can't use two different WhatsApp numbers here in the same phone, as supported in all android right now.These are the issues that I face right now. Apart from this, the phone is good, the sound is loud and clear, it Feels Premium in Hand, the Touch is very good and Face ID works like a charm. Gesture control customisation is really good and you can customise a lot of things.",Reviewed in India on 30 December 2023,/gp/customer-reviews/R3FYB6F4TODK9A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09G9FPGTN,126,India,30-12-2023,POSITIVE

Kapil mehta,4,Iphone 13,"After purchasing the iPhone 13, I‚Äôm genuinely impressed with its performance and features. Here‚Äôs a detailed review based on my experience:### Design and Build QualityThe iPhone 13 feels incredibly premium in hand. The flat edges and matte finish on the back give it a sleek and modern look. The build quality is top-notch, with the Ceramic Shield front adding a layer of durability that gives me confidence in its longevity.### DisplayThe 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display is absolutely stunning. The colors are vibrant, and the blacks are deep, making everything from photos to videos look fantastic. The brightness levels are impressive, and even in direct sunlight, the screen remains perfectly readable. The slightly smaller notch is a nice touch, offering a bit more screen space.### PerformanceThe A15 Bionic chip is a powerhouse. The iPhone 13 handles everything I throw at it with ease, from multitasking to gaming. Apps open almost instantly, and there's no lag whatsoever. It‚Äôs clear that this phone is built for speed and efficiency.### CameraThe camera system on the iPhone 13 is a standout feature. The 12MP wide and ultra-wide lenses capture stunning photos with great detail and color accuracy. Low-light performance is particularly impressive, thanks to the sensor-shift optical image stabilization. The new Photographic Styles and Cinematic mode are fantastic additions, allowing for creative freedom and professional-looking videos.### Battery LifeBattery life has been a pleasant surprise. I easily get through a full day of use on a single charge, even with heavy usage. The efficiency of the A15 Bionic chip and the slightly larger battery make a noticeable difference compared to previous models.### SoftwareiOS 15 is smooth and intuitive. The new features like Focus modes, enhanced FaceTime capabilities, and improved privacy controls make the user experience even better. Everything feels well-integrated and easy to use.### Overall ImpressionThe iPhone 13 has exceeded my expectations. It offers a perfect balance of performance, design, and innovative features. Whether it‚Äôs the stunning display, powerful camera system, or impressive battery life, every aspect of this phone feels well-thought-out and polished. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a premium smartphone experience.",Reviewed in India on 18 July 2024,/gp/customer-reviews/R145X2210U4QUX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09G9FPGTN,137,India,18-07-2024,POSITIVE

Keshav Maheshwari,4,Android to Apple Transition - Not a very smooth experience,"This is my first iPhone and it always feels good to hold this masterpiece. This looks premium not just because of its branding, it has everything which makes it feel premium. However, despite all the looks and finish, the transition from Android to Apple is not very smooth and you may constantly lack certain features that can make life easy. I was using Samsung S10 Lite before this and still have that phone with me. Putting out the feature that is being missed by me-1. Forwarding Anything in Whatsapp: Forwarding anything in Whatsapp from IPhone takes bit more step as compared to what is being offered in Android. This makes the entire process slow for an Android User2. App Switcher: Apple could have easily made App Switcher easy with just light Swipe up, instead they made it with long pressed Swipe up. Why man, why.. You don't have any features for Swipe up, just make it easy to launch.3. Andorid Dialer is Always Missed: Every android has a basic feature, where you can search the contact directly from Phone Dialer, here Dialer is used for Dialing Number only and it will not suggest you similar contact from contacts or last Dial. This is really bad.. If you have to Dial a number directly, use Dialer.. If you have to dial someone from Recent Call log, shift to that and if you to dial someone from contact, shift to that. Man, all this can be done under one button, under dialer. Android user will miss this very badly.4. Sending Multiple Files in Whatsapp: If you wants to add more than 1 file directly from whatsapp, you have to do it twice. In Android, one can simple start selecting from whatspp itself and can select as many files as they wants and can send in a single click. Here for sending multiple files, you have to go to gallery or folder and select all files first and share it through whatsapp.5. No Swipe based shifting from Chats to Status and to calls: In Android Whatsapp, you can switch between Calls, Chats and Status by just swiping, here you have to press button of each.6. Contact Viewing: Contact list sorting method is still out of my mind. Man, make it easy. For example, if one of your contacts First Name or Middle Name or Last Name, any one of thing start with Alphabet ""A"", than it will be shown on top of the list. Apple, pls adopt any one method or at least allow us to customise it.7. Many Apps in Android are much more refined than its version on Apple.8. This is for those who had use Samsung Pay: Samsung Pay was one of the best app for making UPI or Card Payment, just swipe up from home screen of Samsung Phones (Only S Series) and the app is open for payment, I miss that here very badly.9. Lack of Dual Messenger Facility: You can't use two different WhatsApp numbers here in the same phone, as supported in all android right now.These are the issues that I face right now. Apart from this, the phone is good, the sound is loud and clear, it Feels Premium in Hand, the Touch is very good and Face ID works like a charm. Gesture control customization is really good and you can customize a lot of things.",Reviewed in India on 4 February 2023,/gp/customer-reviews/R8P30IIT1LMZJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09G9FPGTN,144,India,04-02-2023,POSITIVE

loading,5,Still one of best base flagships out there in 2024,"Things I liked:1. Solid Build Quality and very polished software (compared to Samsung's One UI)2. Camera:-Rear: Rear camera is pretty decent with good color accuracy in all lighting conditions. Videos are steady and smooth.3. Mic / Speakers: Mic is exceptionally well, isolates all background sounds in noisy situations. Speakers are crisp with good bass.4. Performance: This is where the phone shines, you can throw any app available on the App store and it will run it without breaking a sweat.5. Face Id works like charm, it's the best biometric phone lock out there undoubtedly.Things I wish were better:1. Battery life would have been better, I get up to 4.30 - 5 Hours SOT with mixed usage (high brightness, 1 hour calls, 2-3 hour social media, and 2 hour media playback/music)2. Charges Slow compared to my earlier Samsung. Takes almost 1.2 Hours from 20% to 80%3. Front camera is average, it fails to get correct skin tones and lighting. I keep it on default and still it produces over saturated photos.4. Dialer / phone app sucks. I am someone who makes up to 200 calls a day due to nature of my SCM work. Dialer on Samsung is far better. For unknown call you can add a note to the number in Samsung and it reflect when the person call you again, without having to save unnecessary contacts.

I contacted Amazon for replacement, and they redirected me to apple despite, amazon India has clearly stated that the item is replaceable within 7 days of purchase. Apple detected it as a defective piece and it had to be repaired. I reasoned with them that it's a new product and I don't want to get a repaired or refurbished product. But they said since it is bought from Amazon they cannot replace it, had it been bought on their website or store they would have surely replaced it.Came back to amazon, telling them my experience with Apple as it's a defective product. Apple is suggesting that would also have replaced it, so Amazon please replace it. They denied it flatly. when I asked about why they have mentioned 7 days replacement, on this they don't even say a word but simply repeated themselves that the best advice I have already given to you is that you have to go to Apple there is nothing amazon can do about it.

This is just overnight without the phone having any physical damage or falling. Apple iPlanet care did not even try to physically check on the phone but just said the display has to be changed. Apple customer just opened a case and never even replied back on my complaints about IPlanet care where they did not even bother to check the display and just declared that the display has to be replaced. Someone would never expect a phone which costs around 70k, the display going faulty in just about an year and the apple care and iPlanet care avoid taking ownership of the display issue, its clearly a hardware issue and I have noticed feedback on iPhone 13 from multiple reviews. No doubt iPhone performance wise is the best until you start seeing an issue, the Apple customer care never own issues related to hardware, and anyways their services and parts are extremely costly. Not worthy of buying a device where the hardware goes faulty automatically, probably due to bad quality of displays and the Apple as a company not owning it.I do have a iPhone SE 2nd gen which till date has worked perfectly and no logs, but the service from Apple for the iPhone 13 would make all the new Iphone buyers rething whether you would really risk to buy a phone above 50k and the cutomer care gives you one of the worst experience ever.",Reviewed in India on 29 July 2024,/gp/customer-reviews/RN0TEUKHIMXYC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09G9FPGTN,260,India,29-07-2024,NEGATIVE

This is an over-hyped device which performs poorly on hygiene parameters (for eg. there is no function to go back), has poor precision in touch, limited battery life which dies much before the day ends to name a few.

Vijay G,1,It is a total waste of money!,"Things to remember before you buy an Iphone -1) It is good only untill its warranty is there, for extended warranty, it is 10k approx for one year.2) Under warranty also, it's resell value is only 25k in Apple store, so this itself explains that the mobile is over-priced, and that's why resell value under warranty is 25k which is it's actual value.3) Once the warranty expires - Apple will keep on bringing in updated versions and the updated versions will mall function in a 1 year old Iphone as well. Problems include - Green screen, network issues, etc.4) Many people Iphones underwent Green Screen after the latest update and as their Iphone was not under warranty had to spend 400$ or 11k to 15k depending upon their model for screen repair or change. Meaning Apple company will release update, because of which the Iphone will malfunction and people have to spend money inorder to repair it.5) Iphone - covers, tampered glass are all very expensive and are of third class quality and design. Even after spending 1500 to 2000 INR for an Iphone cover, it will last only for 6-8 months. After that, either it will become dull, dirty or look ugly or pale. An android cover of 250 Rs also functions the same way.6) Apps - That is a total scam everyone knows that. You have to pay for many apps and many apps are still unavailable in App StoreMoral of the story -You can buy an expensive Iphone and use it comfortable for a year or maximum 2. So, if you are ready to spend so much money just for a year, it is the best mobile. For long run, this is just a scam that it will last for a long run.Joke of the year - You will be prompted with features that Iphone and Macbook's only have! - The only issue is, comman man never uses those features! So, people inorder to prove that this is a very unique feature, unnecessarily use it, show it and claim that it could be done only because they have an Iphone. Kudos to them for doing something alien!",Reviewed in India on 7 October 2023,/gp/customer-reviews/RZGED5ZTU6DQF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09G9FPGTN,350,India,07-10-2023,NEGATIVE
