cons
"- Charger reliability issues; the phone does not charge properly with provided accessories.
- Additional payment requested for product handover, leading only to a replacement device instead of direct customer service resolution regarding extra charges demanded by Amazon.
- Phone frequently hangs and exhibits poor battery life requiring charging multiple times daily even on low power mode after rapid drain within hours post usage.
- Overheating during use and video calls; the phone becomes uncomfortably hot to hold, raising safety concerns.
- App performance lags significantly when in use or opening applications/screenshots from photos of text messages are blurry due to touchscreen responsiveness issues.
- Difficulty reaching Apple Support with incorrect information initially provided; the customer faced challenges during initial calls and had to travel for physical inspection at a service center after call failure, leading to inconvenience.
- Struggles obtaining refunds or exchanges due to an expired return period alongside limited resolution options such as resetting phone without addressing core issues; the customer was suggested solutions that did not resolve underlying problems with battery life and performance reliability concerns. 
- Feels overpriced for perceived features, poor battery life, rapid discharge after usage despite additional payment requested before handover process.
- No charger included in purchase or replacement package following damage claims during exchange; the customer is left without a charging solution which affects usability and reliance on third-party accessories that may not be genuine. 
- Difficulty transferring data from Android devices to iPhone due to lack of compatible hardware/software support, leading to potential loss or inconvenience in personal information management between platforms."
