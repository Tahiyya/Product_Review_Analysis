38,Ananth Machiraju,5,The iPhone 13 is the new benchmark for flagship phones...!,"We're pretty confident when we say that the iPhone 13 is the best iPhone for most people. It may look like Apple has only changed the position of one of the phone's back cameras since last year's model, but trust us when we say that there are more substantial upgrades than that. With a new display, larger battery, and better camera hardware and software, the iPhone 13 is the new benchmark for flagship phones.Once again, Apple's made the iPhone 13 far more powerful than its Android competitors thanks to its 5G-ready A15 Bionic chip. If the raw performance doesn't interest you, photographers can play with the new Photographic Style filters in the camera app, while videographers will be excited by the new Cinematic mode focus-racking ability.The regular iPhone 13 has some flaws. The charging is still relatively slow compared to some Android phones. And I don't like that only the iPhone 13 Pro models get a 120Hz display and telephoto zoom. But based on my in-depth iPhone 13 review, this new iPhone is the best phone for the money.The overall display quality continues to be stellar. When watching the trailer for The Matrix Resurrections, I was mesmerized by the neon code encircling Neo as he walked down the street, and in another scene, I could make out individual hairs on Neo‚Äôs beard as he stared up into the sun.DISPLAY1. Smaller notch makes the display a bit more immersive2. Slightly different button placement3. Pink and blue are standout colors4. New Green color launched March 2022CAMERA1.

Machine learning performance notably betterBATTERY LIFE1.10 hours and 33 minutes of battery life, which is 2 hours better than the iPhone 12Software1.SharePlay lets you watch videos and listen to music with friends2. Focus cuts down on distractionsVERDICT :The iPhone 13 improves on what was already the best iPhone for most people by introducing a bunch of welcome enhancements. I especially like the longer battery life, as the iPhone 12‚Äôs endurance was underwhelming even for a 5G phone. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend that iPhone 12 owners upgrade to the new iPhone, but the iPhone 13 is worth it if you own an iPhone 11 or older device.I don‚Äôt think many people will care about the smaller notch. What truly stands out on the iPhone 13 is the camera. The low-light performance is even better now, and computational photography features like Cinematic mode and Photographic styles flex the A15 Bionic‚Äôs muscles in ways that go way beyond benchmarks.I‚Äôm also glad Apple doubled the starting storage at 128GB, as that move was overdue and puts the new iPhone on par with Android flagships. I‚Äôd like to see Apple offering faster charging next time around ‚Äî be it via USB-C or MagSafe ‚Äî as well as a 120Hz display.The bottom line is that the iPhone 13 is a fantastic phone and raises the bar for what you think a camera phone can do.",Reviewed in India on 27 July 2022,/gp/customer-reviews/R3AREU80JEE5EO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09G9FPGTN,39,India,27-07-2022,POSITIVE,re

50,ApTreX,5,Truly worth the money spent! Even if you go broke!,"My honest review after going broke buying this depreciating object.I have been using android phones since the last 10 years and finally decided to switch to iPhone! I used to roast iPhone for its prices, lack of features and also things like power adapter not given in box etc, but my last android phone (iqoo 7 legend) had lot of software related issues and battery issues after updating it to android 12, tired of bugs and software glitches in android, I finally decided to buy a iPhone and switch from android to iOS And Boy Was I right!I never even held an iPhone In my life before because of its price, but now I made a great choice even if I had to spend all my savings on it.iPhone 13 is so smooth that even my IQOO 7 Legend with 120hz feels slower than it even if iPhone has only 60hz. And I can‚Äôt believe what I‚Äôm seeing, all the games/apps are so much smoother and optimised than on android.I was very sceptical about the charging speed of an iPhone Because in Iqoo I had 66w fast charger where as for iPhone I had to buy 20w separate fast charger for 1800rs, but charging speed isn‚Äôt disappointing.Display quality is truly flagship level and I‚Äôm quite a fan of the small 6.1 display believe it or not, being able to reach the top of display with just one hand is very helpful, Build quality is great.I would recommend NOT to waste extra 40k for buying 13 pro. Because I don‚Äôt think having a extra camera telephoto lens is worth spending 40k.You can see in the 3rd image attached the quality of wide angle camera pic shot on my iPhone 13, wide angle camera struggles in low light, but main camera is really good, captures true colours. Front camera is really good too, truly flagship.Speakers are Great.Battery life is better than my previous devices,iOS is very optimised in terms of battery life, easy 8hrs sot on normal usage.NOTE : While playing BGMI you loose around 2% battery every 6minutes at HD + Extreme Graphics. Which is also good. Pro Max Would Be far better in terms of battery.For the software? Yes I feel like there are few downsides, even if the software is very smooth and has very less bugs, it has two annoying things : any game gets paused when you open control centre just to check the battery etc, Lock Screen is annoying and also having to reach the top left corner just to see notifications is also annoying, clearing all notifications is also very annoying.But other than that a perfect 10/10 purchase.

84,debarghyo chaudhuri,4,Review after 1 week of usage,"Got it for 65K on Amazon prime day. So as a lifelong android user I have switched to IOS. So will be dividing this into the pros and negs:Product red 128GBPros:1) Received genuine product from Amazon( was quite sceptic about it though)2) Built quality excellent3) Camera quality excellent. True to life color reproduction, Indoor conditions amazing, night photos are good, facial tones are very good, day clicks are amazing. In short it's an amazing exp. Selfie cam also produces very good quality images. And also no shift in dynamic range while shifting B/W wide and ultra wide cams.4) Display:- Its a really great display, not 120 hz, but the experience is no less than a 120 hz, coz of apple's great software optimization, buttery smooth, no jitters on the screen, won't feel like a 60 hz panel. Now the notch, yes it will be bothering a little bit but its got its own functions, face unlock and stuff (works great in all environmental conditions)after a little while you get adjusted and it got its own magic functions like when when the phone rings and you go close to it, it detects your presence and lowers the vol level.5) Performance: Most powerful processor in the world.6) Battery:- With light usage will easily go for 2 days and with heavy 1 day. Remember to follow a charging pattern and it will give a solid battery exp.7) Speakers: Very loud with a small thumpCons:1) To keep photos and stuff you need to buy storage. 5 GB by default but that's nothing. Download google photos as an alternate sol. if you don't wanna buy storage.2) File management system sucks, android is much better.3) It has dolby atmos but for that you need a subscription to Apple music.4) Does not have a telephoto cam, which I think is a must at this price point.5) Somehow I am not getting 4g+ on my airtel, don't know why but in my android phone always used to get that.6) No USB C7) Siri is dumb AF8) Apple maps are not good, so download Google maps.9) Google keypad is much better than apple's.10) Notification panel and those small things like typing in the notification panel and other things that you can do in android is much much better than apple.11) As of now no haptic feedback while typing maybe coming on IOS 16Note:- Apple ecosystem still exploring that part but whenever you click any pic it automatically gets updated and I can see it in my Macbook also.Overall I would say if you are planning to buy a phone for responsiveness and does the everyday stuff without any hanging problems and stuff then buy it, and also if you are planning to keep it for a long time, then I think its a good investment for the future. Its got Great resale value.Hope this helps in making your decision easier.Update after 2 weeks of usage:All the above points remains the same, but I did check out the ecosystem and the experience has been amazing.1) I can receive and make phone calls (cellular calls) from my macbook, and the call quality is also good.So basically you can keep your phone in some other section of the house and you are working with your macbook somewhere else and if some call comes you can receive that on your macbook. PS:- your phone and macbook should be connected to a similar network, i.e wi-fi.2) Airplay- Just from the lock screen itself i can play any video and also listen to music from my phone. So basically you can watch youtube amazon prime videos(app not in the macbook but present on phone) and other stuff and also listen to music, and the switch of devices is also seamless. So someone in my house can use my macbook to watch movies on amazon prime(playing from my phone) and I can browse linkedin or FB from my iphone.",Reviewed in India on 30 July

136,Kapil mehta,4,Iphone 13,"After purchasing the iPhone 13, I‚Äôm genuinely impressed with its performance and features. Here‚Äôs a detailed review based on my experience:### Design and Build QualityThe iPhone 13 feels incredibly premium in hand. The flat edges and matte finish on the back give it a sleek and modern look. The build quality is top-notch, with the Ceramic Shield front adding a layer of durability that gives me confidence in its longevity.### DisplayThe 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display is absolutely stunning. The colors are vibrant, and the blacks are deep, making everything from photos to videos look fantastic. The brightness levels are impressive, and even in direct sunlight, the screen remains perfectly readable. The slightly smaller notch is a nice touch, offering a bit more screen space.### PerformanceThe A15 Bionic chip is a powerhouse. The iPhone 13 handles everything I throw at it with ease, from multitasking to gaming. Apps open almost instantly, and there's no lag whatsoever. It‚Äôs clear that this phone is built for speed and efficiency.### CameraThe camera system on the iPhone 13 is a standout feature. The 12MP wide and ultra-wide lenses capture stunning photos with great detail and color accuracy. Low-light performance is particularly impressive, thanks to the sensor-shift optical image stabilization. The new Photographic Styles and Cinematic mode are fantastic additions, allowing for creative freedom and professional-looking videos.### Battery LifeBattery life has been a pleasant surprise. I easily get through a full day of use on a single charge, even with heavy usage. The efficiency of the A15 Bionic chip and the slightly larger battery make a noticeable difference compared to previous models.### SoftwareiOS 15 is smooth and intuitive. The new features like Focus modes, enhanced FaceTime capabilities, and improved privacy controls make the user experience even better.

157,loading,5,Still one of best base flagships out there in 2024,"Things I liked:1. Solid Build Quality and very polished software (compared to Samsung's One UI)2. Camera:-Rear: Rear camera is pretty decent with good color accuracy in all lighting conditions. Videos are steady and smooth.3. Mic / Speakers: Mic is exceptionally well, isolates all background sounds in noisy situations. Speakers are crisp with good bass.4. Performance: This is where the phone shines, you can throw any app available on the App store and it will run it without breaking a sweat.5. Face Id works like charm, it's the best biometric phone lock out there undoubtedly.Things I wish were better:1. Battery life would have been better, I get up to 4.30 - 5 Hours SOT with mixed usage (high brightness, 1 hour calls, 2-3 hour social media, and 2 hour media playback/music)2. Charges Slow compared to my earlier Samsung. Takes almost 1.2 Hours from 20% to 80%3. Front camera is average, it fails to get correct skin tones and lighting. I keep it on default and still it produces over saturated photos.4. Dialer / phone app sucks. I am someone who makes up to 200 calls a day due to nature of my SCM work. Dialer on Samsung is far better. For unknown call you can add a note to the number in Samsung and it reflect when the person call you again, without having to save unnecessary contacts.

My screen time lasts 6-7 hours a day which includesMs Teams call, Chatting, YouTube, Surfing random stuffs and BGMI as well.Picture quality is no doubt a killer. I have uploaded a night picture for a sample and I am just speechless. Portrait mode, Video stabilisation, Slow motion are the key feature one would like the most.Everything is awesome but It would have been really good if the price would have been under 45-50 grand bracket . Honestly, I think it is so overrated because of the Brand, public demands, lifestyle and its secured privacy settings.
